# ðŸš€Setup and Installation   
To integrate the Axeptio SDK into your Flutter project, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
flutter pub add axeptio_sdk
```
This command will automatically add the `axeptio_sdk` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file and download the latest available version. After running this command, the SDK will be ready for use in your Flutter project.

Alternatively, you can manually add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` under the dependencies section:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  axeptio_sdk: ^latest_version
```
